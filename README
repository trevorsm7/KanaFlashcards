This is a simple flashcard program that I wrote to help myself learn hiragana and katakana.

Data is loaded from the files/ directory in the jar. A menu item is created for each data file loaded in this way. The file format is specialized for organizing the hiragana and katakana in a compact way.

The first line of the file is the name given to the menu item. Each subsequent line has the format [type] [hiragana] [katakana] [romaji] [audio]

[type] is one of:
n - A normal character.
d - A character with a dakuten or handakuten.
y - A youon character without dakuten.
dy - A youon character with a dakuten or handakuten.

[hiragana], [katakana], and [romaji] are corresponding unicode strings.

[audio] is a path to an audio file in the jar.

The flashcards are generated in three groups, which are selected by the Hiragana and Katakana menu items:
- Hiragana to romaji and romaji to hiragana, when hiragana is selected.
- Katakana to romaji and romaji to katakana, when katakana is selected.
- Hiragana to katakana and katakana to romaji, plus the above, when both are selected.

These are further broken down into four subgroups, selected by the Dakuten and Youon menu items:
- Characters with [type] n, when neither are selected.
- Characters with [type] n or d, when Dakuten is selected.
- Characters with [type] n or y, when Youon is selected.
- Characters with [type] n, d, y, or dy, when both are selected.

The initial commit on github may also be of interest since it uses a more generic file format, allowing for arbitrary question/answer pairs to be specified. I abandoned this format because it was too cumbersome and repetitive for my needs.

The audio clips were borrowed from kana101.com
